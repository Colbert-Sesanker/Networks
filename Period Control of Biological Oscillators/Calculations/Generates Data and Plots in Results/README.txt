1. Install Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. 

2. Install SloppyCell* (http://sloppycell.sourceforge.net/) and ONLY use the Overriden objects in the 
   ReactionNetworks module included in the Supplement. Almost all objects are included in the included
   ReactionNetworks module but SomeSloppy cell objects are missing for IO.

3. The 'analysis_script' generates all the data and plots from functions writen in 'analysis'
